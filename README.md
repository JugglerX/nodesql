# Deck JSON Builder

A experiment in building a static site generator. Rapidly prototype with dummy JSON data or real API data. 

* Create a new HTML file and load the local JSON file or from an external API. 
* The folder structure is automatically scanned for local files, and navigation is displayed
* Files automatically detect css and JSON based on naming conventions
* If a local JSON file exists, but includes a URL in the data, an external API call will be attemped.
* Built on Node/Express
